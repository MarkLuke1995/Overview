                    during my CAD/CAM technical elective. The goal of the project was to reverse engineer a common item
                    with complex geometries within SolidWORKS, and use more complex analysis tool within the program on
                    the model. I was in charge of modelling four structural pieces and performing the drop test.</p>

                        <h2>Team JetCat</h2>
                        <p>Team JetCat was my capstone project over the course of the 2018-19 school year. The scope of
                            our project was to research about jet engine models, design a thrust stand, and statically
                            and dynamically test the mini-turbojet engine. The reason for this project was because there
                            was no model to accurately predict the engine performance for a throttle input to thrust
                            output, and this nearly caused an OSU research UAV to crash during the previous year. Our
                            team ended up being able to statically test the engine for a variety of step throttle
                            inputs, but was unable to complete wind tunnel testing. More detail can be seen in the PDF
                            to the right. </p>
                        <p>My main roles during the project were to help with the design and manufacturing of the thrust
                            stand, and to oversee the testing of the engine. Some of the more notable things I did was
                            the brainstorming of the engine mounting piece to the vertical beam, bolting analysis of the
                            thrust stand, CNC milling of one of the baseplates and bottom engine mounting plate, and
                            addition of a diagonal beam to the thrust stand to increase overall stiffness and reduce
                            vibration during testing. The primary sections of the report I was responsible for included
                            Primary Research (pg. 8), Needs Chart (pg. 11), bolting analysis (pg. 29-31), Thrust Stand
                            Development (pg. 39-40), and Conclusions/Future Work (pg 53).</p>
                        <p>The pictures below show custom manufactured pieces of the thrust stand and a brief look at my
                            bolting analysis. The graphs show stress and safety factor in the critical bolt group for a

                        <h2>CAD Chillout</h2>
                        <p>CAD Chillout Desktop Fan was a semester long project during my Computer Aided Design and
                            Manufacturing technical elective. The idea of the project was to find an everyday item with
                            somewhat complex geometries as well as a minimum number of parts, and reverse engineer it in
                            SolidWORKS. Our team chose a desktop fan as it gave us a chance to see the inner workings of
                            the object, gave insight into how it was created, and allowed us to do an advanced fluid
                            flow study on the fan.</p>
                        <p>In total, I modelled five different parts of the fan, including a bolt and four plastic
                            structural pieces. Below, a dimensioned drawing can be seen from on of the structural
                            pieces, and isometric views of two others. I go into more detail in the report
                            (Difficulties, pg. 13) on some of the challenges of modelling these pieces. An image of
                            stress concentrations during one of the drop tests is also shown, as this ended up being the
                            teams advanced study. I was in change of this, and the analysis can be seen in the report
                            (Simulation, pg. 11-12). A video of one of the drop tests can be seen <a

                        <h2>Machine Elements</h2>
                        <p>The Machine Elements project was a semester long project that incorporated two classes worth
                            of material, Machine Elements I and II. The idea of the project was to create an exhibit for
                            children that showed some mechanical or physics phenomenon. Our idea was to teach kids about
                            projectile motion using a simple ball launcher. The ball launcher consisted of a spring,
                            ball bearing, wire rope, worm gear and regular gear. Kids would pll back on the wire rope
                            after rotating the launcher with the worm gear and ball bearing to aim at different targets
                            within the exhibit. The design itself had to maintain a minimum safety factor of 1.25 for
                            each component while being used for an entire year.</p>
                        <p>I was in charge of designing the spring for the machine. Initially, I attempted to design the
                            spring from the top down, determining the geometric constraints and force needed to launch
                            an baseball about 10 feet. Ignoring friction losses, I came up with a spring constant to
                            design my spring around. However, using this constant and required safety factor, I
                            calculated a long spring with an extremely small wire diameter. The spring would not exist
                            anywhere. So, I decided to take a bottom up approach and find several springs that roughly
                            fit the geometric dimensions needed. I found how much these needed to be deflected to launch
                            the ball the required distance, and then found the stresses experienced by the spring.
                            Analyzing for fatigue stress, one spring was found to maintain the needed safety factor of
                            1.25, and this was chosen. </p>
                        <p>To the right is the full analysis of the spring. Below is the poster the team used to present
                            our project.</p>

                        <h2>Injection Mold</h2>
                        <p>The injection molding project consisted of designing a logo or design in SolidWORKS
                            conforming to several design criteria (no sharp corners, minimum widths or fillets of
                            0.125in, flat surfaces at 0.5 or 0.25in depth for ejector pin holes). These criteria were
                            primarily there for manufacturing purposes, as the smallest tool diameter we were using was
                            0.125in, along with sharp corners being impossible to mill out. Then, using SolidWORKS mold
                            tools, a mold cavity of the design was created. To CNC the cavity, HSMWorks CAM was used to
                            create different functions to mill it out. I used an adaptive and pocket clear to mill out
                            the majority of the work, and contour as a finishing operation.</p>

                        <h2>Radiation Detection and Instrumentation Labs and Abstract</h2>
                        <p>During my studies at Ohio State, I obtained a minor in Nuclear Engineering. One of the
                            classes I took for this was Radiation Instrumentation and Detection with Dr. Cao. Part of
                            the course was to participate in labs biweekly at the OSU Research Reactor. Each of these
                            labs had us explore different commonly used radiation detection sensors and equipment, such
                            as multichannel analyzers and proportional gas filled counters. Below are some graphs of
                            things that I learned and thought were interesting. For example, the first graph shows the
                            wall effect of a BF-3 Proportional Counter, due to radiation particles being absorbed into
                            the walls of the chamber instead of being fully ionized. The next is from a HPGe detector
                            showing off a Radium-226 spectrum, with energy peaks of Bismuth-214 identified. The HPGe
                            detector has an incredibly high resolution which makes it great for identifying radioactive
                            isotopes; however, it is large, expensive and must be kept at cryogenic temperatures to
                            reduce noise. This limits the applications for this detector.</p>

                        <h2>MagLev Controller Design</h2>
                        <p>My MagLev Controller Design project was another semester long project for my Systems
                            Integration and Controls class. The idea of the project was to design a controller for a
                            simplified magnetic levitation system in one direction. The controller had to perform within
                            a specific set of parameters for a height step reference and force step input. Our final
                            controller design ended up being a lead-lead-lag, and was just outside of the control panels
                            for the step reference. Unfortunately, the force step input cause the system to become
                            unstable. This was the best design we were able to find, and shows the importance of trying
                            many different controller designs and gains to obtain control parameters.</p>
                        <p>Going a little more in-depth into each part of the three project parts, the first part
                            entailed determining the static equation of motion (EoM) for the train in the "y" (vertical)
                            direction and linearizing it around a operating point. This showed that the only forces on
                            the train were its weight and the supporting magnetic force. Magnitude and phase plots were
                            drawn from this EoM. A simple block diagram of the system was made in simulink and simulated
                            two force step inputs, one without a reference signal and one with. The second part added in
                            the element of coils to use the electromagnetic force to control the height of the train.
                            The addition of the coils added a new EoM due to the coil acting like an inductor. This was
                            included into the simulink diagram and the new response was simulated, showing the system is
                            unstable without control input. The final part of the project was designing a controller for
                            the dynamic system found. Control parameters were given, and system damping ratio and
                            natural frequency were found from these. Then, a transfer function of the system was
                            determined. Using MatLab's Sisotool, it was shown that P-control was unable to make the
                            system stable. So, a lead-lead-lag controller was chosen to attempt to get the system to
                            conform to the control parameters. Our final design was able to control the system with a
                            step reference but was unable to for a disturbance input. Reports are available for download

                        <h2>Arduino Prototyping Lab</h2>
                        <p>My arduino prototyping lab was a semester long project in my Introduction to Design in
                            Mechanical Engineering course. The projects goal was to get a taste of what it is like
                            designing and prototyping a product from scratch - including brainstorming ideas, figuring
                            out what sensors to use, programming a microcontroller and creating a structure to house the
                            prototype. I lived with 10 roommates that year of college, so I decided to create a door
                            lock sensor so try and remind my other roommates to keep the doors locked. I used an
                            accelerometer to figured out when the door was being open and shut based on some rudimentary
                            experimental acceleration values I found, an IR distance sensor to detect if the lock was
                            horizontal or vertical, a servo with an opened/closed label to visually let the person know
                            if the door was opened or locked, an RGB LED with green meaning open, and red closed, and
                            finally a 7 segment clock display to count the number of times the door was unlocked. The
                            arduino was coded in C using QTCreator.</p>
                        <p>I never ended up using the prototype as it was bulky, and I didn't want to drill into our
                            house door to fixed it above the lock. Below is a video of the device in action, and to

                        <h2>Lab of Sound and Vibration Research</h2>
                        <p>This section will outline the research I performed with Dr. Harne in the <a
                                href="https://lsvr.osu.edu/"><u>Lab of Sound and Vibration Research</u></a>. I was
                            considered a SIMCenter intern and worked on his origami acoustics project. The goal of the
                            research is to come up with ways to control sound pressure at specific points in space
                            without having to do it solely computationally with phase shifts. By doing this with origami
                            arrays, the transducers could become much smaller, easier to transport and much less
                            computationally costly. After reading several of his papers (<a

                                    Acoustics</u></a>, <a
                                href="https://lsvr.osu.edu/sites/lsvr.osu.edu/files/uploads/zou_adaptive_acoustic_energy_delivery_near_far_fields_foldable_tessellated_star_transducers.pdf"><u>Adaptive
                                    Acoustic Energy Delivery</u></a> ) and learning how to use InkScape and Rigid
                            Origami Simulator, I was given an inhouse built FEA code in MatLab for determining sound
                            pressure levels (SPL) at points in space above a specific section of the arrays. This code
                            was limited to arrays that were strictly rectangular, as three of the corners needed to be
                            detected to rotate the array back to its original plane (Rigid Origami Simulator rotated the
                            arrays as they folded up). Using this knowledge and a muira-ori array (seen right) I created
                            a function to determine the farthest three points from the origin that all stayed on the
                            same plane. These points were rotated back to the original plane before the array was broken
                            up into its elements and analyzed for sound pressure. The pictures on the right show the
                            array I was working on before leaving the lab in January 2018.</p>
                        <p>One of the biggest things I learned by doing this research was the importance of verifying a
                            model. When I initially was toying with the FEA code given to me, I was blindly throwing it
                            muira-ori arrays and taking the results as truth. This was a poor way of going about it, as
                            I really had no way of knowing if the results showed the correct SPL. Dr. Harne guided me to
                            a solution to verify that my model was working. I created an arc of an array at a specific
                            length, and input a sound frequency that would be equal to the arc length. By doing this, I
                            would expect that the SPL would reach a local maximum at a radius length away from the
                            center of the array when it is folded up to create a half circle. When I did this, the code
                            I had initially did not indicate these results, and I knew something was wrong with my
                            model. I narrowed it down to the analysis portion of the code. After consulting with Dr.
                            Harne, he sent me a different analysis technique to use. Inputting my test case to verify
                            the model gave the results I expected, a peak in SPL near the radius above the center of the
                            array when folded in half. After this point, I was able to start exploring other arrays, and
                            attempted to create a spherical muira-ori array.</p>

                        <h2>Fundamentals of Engineering Honors: Robot</h2>
                        <p>The Fundamentals of Engineering Honors (FEH) Robot project was an entire course my second
                            semester of first year. With a team of three others, the goal of the project was to create
                            an autonomous robot using the FEH Proteus (microcontroller) that completes a set of tasks on
                            a course, all while remaining under budget and using limited resources available to us from
                            the class store. The theme our year was an artic research outpost, and the robot had to
                            navigate to several areas of the course to grab a sandbag, turn a crank, press buttons in a
                            specific order, drop off the sandbag in a garage, and finally flip a switch. I was in charge
                            of the fabrication of the main structural pieces of the robot and coding of the
                            microcontroller. The main frame was made of wood, and I machined that out using a bandsaw
                            and belt sander. The crank mechanism and button pusher were created in CAD models and 3D
                            printed before being assembled to the robot. Coding the proteus was in C and required me to
                            be in many of the open labs to test out code after uploading it. The hardest part of the
                            coding was controlling the motors to determine distance moved. In competition, our robot
                            ended up not performing optimally; however, our group still did fine in the class. </p>
                        <p>The final report to the right is the most recent version I have, and it outlines most of what
                            we completed but with some of the appendices missing.</p>
